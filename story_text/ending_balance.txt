THE ETERNAL WATCH

The Dragon inclines its head.
A gesture older than kingdoms.

With a single beat of its wings,
it vanishes beyond cloud and memory.

The Dragons do not rule.
Nor are they erased.

They sleep.
And the world endures—
trembling, hopeful, unbroken.

You depart without song or crown,
warden of a fragile dawn.
