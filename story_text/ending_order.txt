THE SILENCE OF ORDER

The great wyrm falls.
And with it, the skies grow still.

The Iron Vow marches without mercy,
scouring scale and flame from the world.

Peace is proclaimed.
Yet the age of wonder bleeds away unseen.

You are crowned a savior.
But in quieter tongues,
they name you the slayer of miracles.
