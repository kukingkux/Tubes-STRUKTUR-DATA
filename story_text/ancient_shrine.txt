“This place… it hums with the same energy as the words.”

You stand before an ancient shrine, half-buried in the earth. Faint blue runes glow on its surface.
The air feels thick, charged with potential. You feel your understanding of the words you've learned expanding.
This is a place where power can be cultivated.
